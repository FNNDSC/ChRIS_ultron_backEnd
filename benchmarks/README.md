# CUBE Load & Scalability Benchmark

A repo-native benchmark suite for CUBE. It measures **both of CUBE's performance surfaces** —
the asynchronous **data plane** (orchestration) and the synchronous **control plane** (the
API) — each with the right tool and metrics:

- a **data plane** harness that drives real plugin-instance DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) end-to-end and
  **auto-escalates one factor at a time until CUBE breaks** (Celery + pfcon + Docker +
  `fslink` storage), writing a ticket-ready breaking-point report;
- a **control plane** Locust load test (`locustfile.py`, via `just bench-locust`) that
  drives concurrent API clients and reports **RED** (rate, errors, duration percentiles):
  the API saturation knee and DB connection-pool limits (see [§ Control plane](#control-plane-api-saturation-with-locust-red)).

`chris_api.py` is the shared Collection+JSON adapter used by both. See [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md)
for the design rationale and [envelope.md](envelope.md) for the pinned resource envelope.

**Findings:** the full analysis and recommendations are in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md);
[history/README.md](history/README.md) indexes the committed milestone runs and the exact
commands used to generate each result.

## Quick start

```bash
just bench-start                 # bring up the fslink stack with the uvicorn envelope + plugins
just bench-run --tier smoke      # ~2 min sanity sweep
just bench-run --tier default    # ~15-30 min directional sweep (laptop)
just bench-run --tier full       # overnight breaking-point sweep on a dedicated Linux box
just bench-report <run_id>       # re-render report.md from a results dir
just bench-compare <a> <b> [...] # diff runs over time (breaking points, makespan, p95)
just bench-archive <run_id>      # keep a run's small artifacts in version control
just bench-test                  # run the harness unit tests in-container
just bench-locust '-u 100 -t 3m' # control-plane RED load test (Locust); CSVs -> results/locust/
just bench-down                  # stop the stack
just bench-bash                  # shell in the benchmark container (debugging)
just bench-compose <args>        # low-level compose helper the other bench-* recipes wrap
```

The **combined-stress number** — how many concurrent feeds before CUBE breaks —
is the linear `feeds` axis of the `full` tier. For a heavier per-feed DAG and a single
repeat (each scenario is large), run it directly:

```bash
just bench-run --tier full --topology linear --axis feeds --cap 128 --repeat 1 --file-count 100
```

Useful flags (`just bench-run -- <flags>`):

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--tier smoke\|default\|full\|aging-grow\|aging-probe` | matrix tier (see `matrix.yml`) |
| `--topology linear\|fanout_fanin\|diamond` | restrict to one topology |
| `--axis depth\|branches\|layers\|merges\|feeds\|file_count` | restrict to one escalation axis |
| `--cap N` | override every axis cap |
| `--repeat N` | override repeats per level |
| `--file-size 1MiB` | override the baseline file size (the 2-point size sanity check) |
| `--file-count N` | override the baseline file count (held while escalating another axis) |
| `--sleep-length 5` | override simpledsapp sleepLength in whole seconds (long-active-job workload class) |
| `--no-cleanup` | keep created feeds (study cumulative-growth effects; skips the quiesce gate) |
| `--restart-on-fail` | restart services if health doesn't recover after a failure |

## Data plane: the escalation engine

For each topology and each escalation axis, the runner holds every other dimension at the
tier baseline and escalates the axis `1, 2, 4, 8 …` (`file_count` by decades:
`1, 10, 100 …`) up to a cap, repeating `R` times per level, until a **hard failure**
marks the breaking point:

- **PASS** — keep escalating.
- **DEGRADED** — an SLO (service-level objective) breach (e.g. p95 latency over threshold); recorded, escalation
  continues toward the real wall.
- **FAIL** — a hard failure (any `finishedWithError`/`cancelled` instance, any 5xx/timeout,
  no-progress, scenario timeout, or a build error); records the breaking point, recovers
  (reap job containers, capture logs, health-check), and moves to the next axis. Remaining
  repeats at a failing level are skipped — re-running an already-broken stack proves
  nothing and costs up to a scenario-timeout each.

Between scenarios the runner deletes the created feeds and then **waits for quiescence**
(global feed/instance counts back at the pre-scenario baseline): feed deletion in CUBE is
asynchronous, and without the gate its churn would contaminate the next level's numbers.

Three topologies (`linear`, `fanout_fanin`, `diamond`) are built from `dbg-bigfiles` (fs
root), `pl-simpledsapp` (ds), and `pl-topologicalcopy` (ts merge) — all installed by
chrisomatic.

## Reading the results

Each run writes `benchmarks/results/<run_id>/`:

```
report.md            # ticket-ready: environment, breaking-point table, approach-to-failure curves
summary.json         # machine-readable run summary
levels.jsonl/.csv    # one row per (topology, axis, level): the approach-to-failure curve
environment.json     # host hardware, image ids, envelope knobs, noise floor, attribution availability
api_requests.jsonl   # every measured API call (latency, status, endpoint class)
status_samples.jsonl # per-instance status timelines (client-observed phase timing)
docker_stats.jsonl   # service + job container CPU/mem/blkio samples
queue_depths.jsonl   # Celery queue depths (main1/main2/periodic), sampled every 2 s
scenarios/<id>/      # scenario.json (+ pg_stats.json; failure.json + logs/ on hard failures)
```

The key artifact is the **approach-to-failure curve** (in `report.md` and `levels.csv`):
per-level makespan, worst p95, 5xx counts, completions, and peak per-service CPU and disk
write — so each breaking point comes with a *cause*, not just a pass/fail.

Two attribution streams turn resource saturation into named culprits:

- **Queue depths** — a sustained rise on `main2` means status checks are produced
  faster than the workers consume them; `main1` is job submission. Per-scenario
  peaks/means are in `scenario.json` (`queues`) and level rows (`peak_queue_depth`).
- **`pg_stats.json`** — top statements by total execution time, reset per scenario
  (via `pg_stat_statements`; the benchmark compose preloads it on `db`). Names the
  queries behind a hot db. `environment.json`'s `attribution` block records whether
  both streams were available for the run.

## Control plane: API saturation with Locust (RED)

The escalation harness above measures the **data plane** (orchestration). The **control
plane** — the synchronous API + DB + connection pool — is measured separately with a Locust
load test that drives concurrent API clients and reports **RED** (rate, errors, duration
percentiles): the saturation knee, error onset, and DB connection-pool exhaustion that the
data plane doesn't surface. Bring the stack up (`just bench-start`), then:

```bash
just bench-locust '-u 100 -r 20 -t 3m'   # 100 users, ramp 20/s, for 3 minutes
```

It is **read-only by default** (list feeds/instances/files, plugin search) — the cleanest
saturation signal, and it won't flood the compute side. Set `BENCH_LOCUST_WRITE=1` to also
exercise the create path (it spawns real DAGs, so run on a stack you can `just nuke`).
`host` comes from `CUBE_URL` (no `--host` needed); auth is once via a DRF (Django REST Framework) token, like the
data-plane harness.

To find the knee, sweep the user count, giving each level its own CSV prefix:

```bash
for u in 25 50 100 200 400; do
  just bench-locust "-u $u -r $u -t 90s --csv /app/benchmarks/results/locust/read_u$u"
done
```

Locust writes `*_stats.csv` / `*_failures.csv` to `benchmarks/results/locust/` (a plain run
uses the `run_*` prefix). Render a human-readable summary — the control-plane counterpart of
the data-plane `report.md` — with:

```bash
python -m benchmarks.locust_report benchmarks/results/locust   # writes report.md there
```

**Reading it:** throughput climbs to a peak then *collapses* past the knee while p95 spikes;
a p95 pinned at `CUBE_DB_POOL_TIMEOUT` (10 s) with rising 5xx/401s is the signature of **DB
connection-pool exhaustion** (pool size × uvicorn workers vs `db` CPUs). See
[REPORT.md](REPORT.md) §4 for the measured curve and [history/README.md](history/README.md)
for the archived RED report.

## Comparing runs over time

Every run records a **workload fingerprint** (the effective tier baseline + axes +
cadence, hashed), the full envelope, host manifest, and auth mode — enough to decide
later whether two runs are comparable and to diff them:

```bash
just bench-compare <baseline_run_id> <candidate_run_id>
just bench-compare A B C D                        # 3+ runs: adds a per-axis trend table
just bench-compare A B --fail-on-regression       # CI gate: exit 1 on any regression,
                                                  # downward breaking-point shift, or
                                                  # when the runs are NOT COMPARABLE
```

Run ids resolve against `results/` and the committed `history/` archive alike. The
output (`results/comparisons/<a>_vs_<b>/compare.{md,csv}`) leads with a
**comparability verdict**: workload-fingerprint / storage / auth mismatches are
*blockers* (the diff is still rendered, loudly labelled), envelope / host / threshold
differences are *cautions*, and commit or image differences are the point of comparing.

A level is flagged **REGRESSED**/**IMPROVED** only when the change exceeds *both* the
relative threshold (`--regress-pct`, default 20%) and the metric's absolute floor
(`--makespan-floor` 2 s — makespan is quantized by the poll cadence; `--latency-floor`
50 ms — below the API noise floor). Verdict flips and **per-axis breaking-point
shifts** (the most noise-robust trend signal) are flagged regardless.

To build a history worth comparing against, archive milestone runs:

```bash
just bench-archive <run_id>     # copies summary.json, levels.jsonl, environment.json and
                                # the rendered report.md (a few KB) into
                                # benchmarks/history/<run_id>/
```

Commit the archived run together with the change it validates; raw streams
(`api_requests.jsonl`, `docker_stats.jsonl`) stay out of version control.

## Measuring state aging

CUBE accumulates feeds/files over years; a benchmark on a fresh DB misses
time-degradation. The `aging-*` tiers measure it as a loop:

```bash
just bench-run --tier aging-grow --no-cleanup   # accumulate rows (~56k files/invocation)
just bench-run --tier aging-probe               # fixed 2-instance probe, with cleanup
```

Alternate them N times; plot the probe's makespan and create/list p95 against the
absolute row counts each scenario records in `db_deltas`
(`feeds_total`/`instances_total`/`files_total`). Growth is permanent by design — run on
a stack you can `just nuke` afterwards.

## Caveats (v1)

- **Phase timing is client-observed.** CUBE keeps no status-transition history, so the
  poller timestamps the first sighting of each status — resolution equals the poll
  cadence, which itself stretches (up to 5 s) as the feeds axis escalates to keep the
  harness's own observation traffic bounded. Each `scenario.json` records the effective
  cadence and the poll request count under `observer`.
- **The harness authenticates once via a DRF token.** Per-request HTTP Basic would make
  CUBE run its password hasher on every call (~100 ms each) and distort every number; if
  the report's environment section says `basic`, the run is degraded — fix auth and re-run.
- **`fslink` hides byte-copy cost.** File **count** is the real control-plane stressor;
  file **size** is a sanity check only (escalate count, not size, for meaningful results).
- **Makespan is poll-gated.** Record `CUBE_CELERY_POLL_INTERVAL`; run the sweep at
  `2s`, `4s` and `8s` to separate poller cost from CUBE's true capacity. Do **not** go
  below `2s`: the `skip_if_running` guard's ~1 s `inspect()` broadcast makes the
  periodic scheduler tasks mutually skip at sub-2 s cadences (see `envelope.md`).
- **Run authoritative sweeps on a dedicated Linux box.** On Docker Desktop the VM's own
  limits dominate the per-container envelope, so laptop numbers are directional only.
- **Pin the workload plugin versions.** Runs used `dbg-bigfiles` 1.0.0, `pl-simpledsapp`
  2.1.5, `pl-topologicalcopy` 1.0.12. The harness resolves each plugin by name and uses the
  first match (CUBE's `-version` order), so install **exactly one version of each** — with
  several present it silently binds to the lexicographically-highest version string, not the
  pinned one (see STRATEGY.md § Workload Plugins).

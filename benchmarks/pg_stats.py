"""
Per-scenario ``pg_stat_statements`` snapshots (best-effort).

Turns "db CPU at 210%" into named queries: the runner resets the statement stats at
scenario start and snapshots every statement recorded since, most total execution time
first, persisting them under ``scenarios/<id>/pg_stats.json``. Keeping all of them, not
just the expensive ones, is what lets a run show that a cheap statement no longer runs.

Runs ``psql`` *inside* the db container via the Docker socket (no client-side
postgres dependency); credentials come from the container's own ``POSTGRES_*`` env.
Requires ``shared_preload_libraries=pg_stat_statements`` — ``postgres/cube.conf`` sets it
on both compose stacks — and degrades to unavailable (with the reason recorded once)
otherwise.

``connection_states`` uses the same access for ``pg_stat_activity``: how many connections
each client holds and in which state, which tells idle pooled connections apart from ones
left ``idle in transaction``.

``server_settings`` and ``server_counters`` use it too: the settings the server runs with,
which the environment manifest records, and its cumulative counters (checkpoints, WAL, temp
files, writes by process type, autovacuum runs), which the runner snapshots around each
scenario, together with the db container's cgroup counters, and turns into per-window
deltas with ``counter_windows``.

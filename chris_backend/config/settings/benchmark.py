"""
Benchmark settings: the development stack with a production-like, *recorded* envelope.

Identical to ``local`` except that the artificially tiny dev DB connection pool is made an
explicit, env-driven knob, ``DEBUG`` is off unless ``CUBE_DEBUG`` asks for it, as in
production (which also drops the debug toolbar and serves static files without the
collectstatic manifest), and ``CUBE_DB_POOL_STATS_INTERVAL`` can make the API workers log
their pool counters. The benchmark measures CUBE's architecture capacity, so the pool,
``DEBUG``, the number of uvicorn workers (set on the ``chris`` service's command), and
Postgres ``max_connections`` (set on the ``db`` service's command) are all pinned in
``docker-compose.benchmark.yml`` and recorded in every report.

Normal development is unaffected — only the benchmark compose profile selects this module.

"""
The shared cache and the coordination helpers built on it.

``CACHES['default']`` is Django's ``RedisCache`` on a Redis-protocol server of its own
(``chris-cache`` in the compose stacks, a Dragonfly) apart from the Celery broker's: it
evicts when it is full and starts empty after a restart so whatever it holds may go
missing at any time. All coordination keys created by these helpers expire automatically.
Do not call cache.clear(): it deletes every key in this cache's Redis logical database,
not just keys with this application's prefix (Redis/Dragonfly FLUSHDB).

The helpers, all safe to call from any thread or process:

- ``acquire_lock`` / ``release_lock``: a lock held until released or for ``ttl`` seconds
- ``mark_once`` / ``clear_mark``: true for the first caller in a window of ``ttl`` seconds
- ``acquire_slot`` / ``release_slot``: a bounded counter, at most ``ceiling`` leases of
  ``ttl`` seconds each, so a lease its holder never releases frees itself

They fail open. When the cache does not answer or refuses a command they go ahead as if
it had granted it, so whatever a lock or marker guards must stay correct when it runs
twice. When it does not answer they also log the degraded mode once and stop trying for a
few seconds, after which one call tries it while the others wait for its outcome. A
release or a clear that cannot reach the cache is kept and the process's next helper call
after the cache answers again replays it; a process that makes no further call leaves it
to its TTL.

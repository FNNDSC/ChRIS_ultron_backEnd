==================
REST API Reference
==================

This API uses the standard Collection+JSON_ hypermedia type to exchange resource
representations with clients. All the functionality provided by the API can be
discovered by clients by doing :http:method:`get` requests to links ("href" elements)
presented by the hypermedia documents returned by the web server, starting with the API's
"home page".

.. _Collection+JSON: http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/


The API's "home page" relative url is: /api/v1/ which serves a user-specific `collection
of feeds`_.

.. _`collection of feeds`: collections/feed.html


There are two main types of resources served by the API:

**Collection**
  A resource to group other resources together. Its representation focuses on links to
  other resources, though it may also include snippets from the representations of those
  other resources.

**Item**
  A standalone resource that is linked to from a collectionâ€™s representation.


The following table shows the API's HTTP protocol semantics for these resource types:
